% Applied to venios customers
% As such done on real grids, instead of sythetic examples.
% Specifically this is being done on entire grid areas, thus isntead of disconnecitng
% lines we start from the existing grid structure and reconfigure it for better results
% No other load shedding mechanisms, or other control mechanisms
% Fixed generation and consumption (this si largly due to regulations)
% This is to be applied in an operational context: i.e. we take the current state
% of the grid with its current generation and topology and determine the best switch
% state within. Defining the "best" switchstate is not straightforward as switching
% impacts different parameters in the gird in different ways. Thus different
% optimization goals are presented, which can then be selected as needed or prefered
% in the operational context

% One restriction being imposed witin this work is single feed in, meaning that only
% one transformer supplies a given distribution grid.
