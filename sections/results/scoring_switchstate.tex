We propose the following equation to score a switch state:

\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        s &= s_{voltage} * w_{voltage}\\
        & + s_{line \ avg} * w_{line \ avg} + s_{line \ max} * w_{line \ max}\\
        & + s_{trafo \ avg} * w_{trafo \ avg} + s_{trafo \ max} * w_{trafo \ max}\\
        & + s_{loss} * w_{loss},
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:score}
\end{align}

where $s_x$ are scores for different operational aspects
and $w_x$ the weights to prioritize or de-prioritize each of these
aspects. The entire equation is normalized to produce values between 0 and 1.\\
As such the weights need to have values between 0 and 1, as well as sum to 1:

\begin{equation}
    w_{voltage} + w_{line \ avg} + w_{line \ max} + w_{trafo \ avg} + w_{trafo \ max} + w_{losses} = 1.
\end{equation}

This equation is introduced by us to unify operating voltage,
line and transformer utilization,
line and transformer limits as well as line losses in a
single score. These 
aspects are the most commonly used ones by grid operators to assess their
grid\autocite{venios}.

\subsection{Voltage score}

We define the voltage score as:

\begin{equation}
    s_{voltage} = clamp(\frac{V_{rated}*(1+\Delta_{V}) - V_{max}
                +       V_{min} - V_{rated}*(1-\Delta_{V})}
                {{V_{rated}*\Delta_{V}}*2}),
                \label{eq:score:voltage}
\end{equation}

where $V_{rated}$ is the rated operating voltage of the grid, $\Delta_V$ the maximum allowed
voltage deviation as a fraction of the rated voltage, $V_{min}$ the minimum voltage  within
the switch state, $V_{max}$ the maximum voltage within the switch state and $clamp()$ being
defined as:

\begin{equation}
    clamp(x) =
    \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{if} \ x < 0\\
        x & \text{if} \ 0 < x < 1\\
        1 & \text{if} \ x > 1
    \end{cases}.
\end{equation}

This score linearly decreases with the minimum and maximum voltages, 
$V_{min}$ and $V_{max}$ deviating further from the rated voltage $V_{rated}$.
The score drops to zero if both $V_{max}$ and $V_{min}$ are outside the
maximum voltage deviation defined through $\Delta_V$.

\subsection{Line utilization score}

The maximum line utilization score is defined as

\begin{equation}
    s_{line \ max} = clamp(\frac{\eta_{line \ max} - max(\{\eta_{ij} : (i, j) \in \mathfrak{E}_{ij}\})}{\eta_{line \ max}})
\end{equation}

average score as

\begin{equation}
    s_{line \ avg} = clamp(\frac{\eta_{line \ avg} - \frac{\sum_{(i, j) \in \mathfrak{E}_{ij}} \eta_{ij}}{|\mathfrak{E}_{ij}|}}{\eta_{line \ avg}}),
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{line \ max}$ and $\eta_{line \ avg}$ are the limits
allowed for the maximum and average currents, before the score drops to 0.
$\eta_{ij}$ is used as defined in \autoref{eq:measures:cable_utilization}.
$\mathfrak{E}_{ij}$ is the set of all cables of the
grid as defined in \autoref{eq:graph_theory:edge_list}
(Important: it is not just the set of edges of one template, but rather of all edges in 
a partition).

\subsection{Transformer utilization score}

The transformer utilization score is defined similarly
to the cable utilization score with

\begin{equation}
    s_{trafo \ max} = clamp(\frac{\eta_{trafo \ max} - max(\{\eta_{t} : 0 < t < |T|\})}{\eta_{trafo \ max}})
\end{equation}

average score as

\begin{equation}
    s_{trafo \ avg} = clamp(\frac{\eta_{trafo \ avg} - \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{|T|} \eta_t}{|T|}}{\eta_{trafo \ avg}}),
\end{equation}

where $T$ is the set of templates. $\eta_{trafo \ max}$ as well as $\eta_{trafo \ avg}$ 
work similar to the cable limits $\eta_{line \ max}$ and $\eta_{line \ avg}$.

\subsection{Line loss Score}

To calculate a line loss score that is comparable between switch states a suitable
normalization method needs to be employed. The approach taken by us is to use the 
sum over all generated and consumed power as such:

\begin{equation}
    |S|_{total} = \sum_{i=0}^N |P_i| + |Q_i|.
\end{equation}

The rational being, that the more power is generated
or consumed within a grid
the more losses should also occur. 
The absolute value is calculated are component wise
and not as a magnitude as resistive and reactive 
power losses also add up component wise.\\
\\
We define the line loss score as such:

\begin{equation}
    s_{loss} = clamp(\frac{\alpha \sum_{(i, j) \in \mathfrak{E}_{ij}} P_{ij, \ loss} + Q_{ij, \ loss}}{|S|_{total}}),
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is a correction term as line losses are usually an order of magnitude
smaller than $|S|_{total}$.

\subsection{Limits and weights used}

    \begin{tabular}{l l p{10cm}}
        Limit or weight & Value & Notes\\
        \hline
        $V_{rated}$         & $400V$ & Voltage within the 3-phase low voltage grid\\
        $\Delta_V$          & $0.15$ & $15\%$ voltage deviation is often used as an acceptable limit by grid operators\autocite{venios}\\
        $\eta_{line \ avg}$ & $1$    & \\
        $\eta_{line \ max}$ & $2.5$  & Rated current is not maximum allowed current, as such higher currents may occur\\
        $\eta_{trafo \ avg}$& $1$    & \\
        $\eta_{trafo \ max}$& $1.5$  & Rated power is not maximum allowed power, as such higher currents may occur\\
        $\alpha$            & $40$   & Determined through trial and error\\
        $w_{voltage}$       & $1/4$  & All 4 score categories set to contribute equally\\
        $w_{line \ avg}$    & $1/8$  & All 4 score categories set to contribute equally, there are 2 line utilization measures\\
        $w_{line \ max}$    & $1/8$  & All 4 score categories set to contribute equally, there are 2 line utilization measures\\
        $w_{trafo\ avg}$    & $1/8$  & All 4 score categories set to contribute equally, there are 2 transformer utilization measures\\
        $w_{trafo\ max}$    & $1/8$  & All 4 score categories set to contribute equally, there are 2 transformer utilization measures\\
        $w_{loss}$          & $1/4$  & All 4 score categories set to contribute equally
    \end{tabular}

\end{figure}

As mentioned all weights and limits are chosen such that they are meaningful to grid operators
and can be tweaked by them as needed. For all switch state scores within this work the values
in \autoref{table:score:values} have been used.
