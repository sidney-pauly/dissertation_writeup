\subsection{Implementing simulated annealing for switch states}

\autoref{alg:annealing} show an implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm.
There are many ways to implement the probability function \texttt{p()}. For this work
a probability closely resembling the Boltzmann probability was chosen:

\begin{equation}
    p_c(\Delta E, T) = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if} \ \Delta E \leq 1\\
        e^{(-\gamma \Delta E/ T)} & \text{if} \ \Delta E > 1
    \end{cases} 
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ is a constant that can be tweaked for best optimization performance.
For the energy of the system the scoring function (\autoref{eq:score}) is used:

\begin{equation}
    E = 1 - s
\end{equation}

Lastly to get a new random adjacent switch state \autoref{alg:ssexp:adjacent}
is used.
