The holistic overview of graph covering given in this article attempts to close this gap. The focus lies on a characterization and classification of the different problems discussed in the literature. In addition, notable results and common approaches are also included. Whenever appropriate, this review extends to the corresponding partitioning problems.}

abstract = {We consider the problem of covering an input graph H with graphs from a fixed covering class G. The classical covering number of H with respect to G is the minimum number of graphs from G needed to cover the edges of H without covering non-edges of H. We introduce a unifying notion of three covering parameters with respect to G, two of which are novel concepts only considered in special cases before: the local and the folded covering number. Each parameter measures “how far” H is from G in a different way. Whereas the folded covering number has been investigated thoroughly for some covering classes, e.g., interval graphs and planar graphs, the local covering number has received little attention. We provide new bounds on each covering number with respect to the following covering classes: linear forests, star forests, caterpillar forests, and interval graphs. The classical graph parameters that result this way are interval number, track number, linear arboricity, star arboricity, and caterpillar arboricity. As input graphs we consider graphs of bounded degeneracy, bounded degree, bounded tree-width or bounded simple tree-width, as well as outerplanar, planar bipartite, and planar graphs. For several pairs of an input class and a covering class we determine exactly the maximum ordinary, local, and folded covering number of an input graph with respect to that covering class.}

  abstract={Research on distributed generation in power systems is of great interest due to its potential benefits in reducing environmental impact and improving overall system reliability and efficiency. The switch allocation problem (SAP) encompasses a series of decision-making faced by power distribution utilities concerning: (i) the number; (ii) type (manual or remote-controlled); (iii) capacity; and (iv) location of switches in a network to minimize operational costs while maintaining acceptable levels of reliability. This work proposes an efficient solution methodology for SAP that can solve large networks with distributed generation. The methodology is based on memetic algorithms embedded with a hierarchical population and local search procedures. Statistical analysis is conducted to determine the optimal values of hyperparameters. A case study on a real-life network (5523 nodes) from the state of S{\~a}o Paulo (Brazil) shows the methodology providing substantial cost reductions compared to the real-world solution implemented by the utility, and the potential benefits resulting from the presence of distributed generation. Also, the proposed approach was evaluated with six well-known instances present in the literature. The proposed methodology solved most of these instances in under minutes and achieved a substantial reduction of the reliability index metric employed, namely, SAIDI.},
